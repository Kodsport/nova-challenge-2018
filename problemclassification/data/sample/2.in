problem classification
when reading programming problems one can often get some hints regarding the
topic of the problem by skimming the problem statement for certain words
if for example the word vertex or edge appears the problem is almost
certainly a graph problem while the words words or letters suggest that the
problem is about strings
your task is to implement a simple program that attempts to classify a
problem according to one of n categories
each category has an associated set of words which if they appear as words
in a statement suggest the problem belongs to this category
when classifying a statement the program should suggest those categories
which have the highest number of occurences of their associated words
in the above example we suggested that the category graph may have the
associated words vertex and edge and the category string could have the
associated words words and letters
then if there were three occurances each of the words vertex and graph the
number of matches for the category graph would be six
if the statement contained thirteen occurances of word and four of letter
the number of matches for the category string would be seventeen
since there are more matches for the second category the program should
suggest it
if there are multiple categories with the same number of matches your
program should suggest all of them
input
the first line of input contains the number of categories n between one and
ten
the next n lines each contain a description of a category
the description starts with the name of the category which is a single word
then an integer between one and ten the number of words associated with
this category
this is followed by those w words separated by spaces
this is followed by a number of lines describing the statement of the
problem
each line contains a list of space separated words
every word in the input will consist solely of lower case letters a to z
output
for each suggested category output the name of the category on a single
line in lexicographical order
