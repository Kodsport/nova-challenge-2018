graph 3 query vertex hamiltonian
geometry 3 euclid range vertex
math 3 euclid hamiltonian sum
datastructure 3 query range sum
consider the hamiltonian graph where each vertex corresponds to an
linear equation we can solve these using the euclid algorithm
now you will recieve a query corresponding to a range of
vertices your task is to compute the sum of the minimum solution
of those vertices
